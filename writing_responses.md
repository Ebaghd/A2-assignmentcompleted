# a2: Writing Responses
Please  respond to the following three  prompts.
## Think: Writing Prompt 1
According to O'Neil, data scientists build "models" of processes. In your own words (a) What is a "model;"" and (b) Why are models so important in data science? (Hint: See p. 18, last paragraph) [40 - 60 words] [4 points]

> a) A model is a replica of something that involves information/data. It takes relevant information and applies it to make predictions of future cases.  
b) Models are so important in data science because they can help us make predictions on future events and to predict future data trends. It can show us what to expect and help us make choices. Models are how we can utilize data to predict the future and benefit from our data.


## Think: Writing Prompt 2
At the end of Chapter 1, O'Neil gives three elements of models that can make them dangerous. Name and briefly describe each element. [3 points]

> (1) **Opacity-** Lacking transparency, both the assumption and conclusion not clear for all to see.   
(2)  **Scale-** The potential of a model to exponentially grow to impact many people     
(3)  **Damage-** The ability of a model to define, delimit , and have a negative impact on our lives.

## Reflect and Write
For this assignment, you've read a lot of technical material and you've solved a bunch of coding puzzles. Please reflect on **how you are learning how to learn to code**. What is hard? What is easy?  What is working? How might you improve your learning? Please consider these and similar questions and write. [about 50 words] [3 points]

> I find it difficult to adapt to the R language from Java. I feel that R has a different way of solving problems and thinking about problems than Java. Java makes use of more for loops and conditional statements, whereas R makes use of built in features more. However, my previous knowledge of Java also makes R easier to learn. Debugging and testing small parts of my code at a time is working for me. I can improve my learning by coding in R during free time.
